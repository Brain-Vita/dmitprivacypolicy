Welcome to the DMIT app for Android!

This is an Android app developed by www.BrainVita.com. The app is available on Google Play.

As avid Android users ourselves, we take privacy very seriously. We know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge. We have programmed this app to collect any only the necessary personally identifiable information for authentication purposes. All data shared by you is stored in our database only and is not shared with any third-party application. All images are stored securedly on our cloud and isn't shared with any third-party vendors/applications.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.
